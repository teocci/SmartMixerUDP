# Android UDP Audio Chat Application

## What is it?

This is a basic UDP audio chat implementation for Android. This application is designed to allow Android devices, engaging in audio conversations over a local wireless network. 

The app has the ability to discover other devices on the network which are currently running the application.

Users can select one of the display names and attempt to initiate an audio chat session with the chosen device.
